# Fruit Ninja
This project is inspired by the popular mobile game “Fruit Ninja”. The idea of the game is as follows: You
have 3 lives. A fruit is randomly thrown from either the left or right side of the screen, and
you should slice the fruit! You slice the fruit by passing your cursor over it. However, if you
miss the fruit and do not slice it before it falls away from the screen, you lose a life. Also, a
bomb could randomly be thrown. If you hit the bomb, its game over! You can choose 4
difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard, Insane. There is also a little surprise in the game over
screen if you hit the bomb :).

There is also audio in the project, with sound effects for slicing the fruits, when its game over, and there is 
a song playing in the backgroung (Hotline Bling by Drake) If you want, it is possible to stop the music by pressing the 
mute button, but I recommend playing the game with volume as it enhances the experience :)
